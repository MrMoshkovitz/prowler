# Prioritizing AWS Security Groups Findings

## Scoring Risks Automatically:

### 1. Assessing Business Impact:
* **Example 1:** Prioritize security groups that protect payment systems, as they have a direct impact on revenue.
* **Example 2:** Focus on the security groups that protect the companyâ€™s main website, as any downtime or breach could damage its brand reputation.


### 2. Network Context Analysis:
* **Example 1:** Assign a higher priority to security groups on public subnets when exposed to the Internet (e.g., web servers).
* **Example 2:** Prioritize security groups that control access to critical internal services, such as a database within a private subnet.


### 3. Consideration of user identity context:
* **Example 1:** Pay more attention to security groups associated with resources accessed by administrative IAM roles.
* **Example 2:** Prioritize expected security groups for accessing shared resources used by multiple departments.


### 4.  Analyzing Historical Behavior:
* **Example 1:** Verify the changed security groups in previous security issues.
* **Example 2:** Check the frequently updated security groups to ensure best practices are followed.


## 5. Addressing Compliance and Regulatory Requirements:
* **Example 1:** Prioritize security groups that must comply with GDPR to avoid potential penalties.
* **Example 2:** Ensure security groups handling healthcare data comply with HIPAA, as non-compliance could result in legal complications.
